  abstract = {ABSTRACT We review geological evidence on the origin of the modern transcontinental Amazon River, and the paleogeographic history of riverine connections among the principal sedimentary basins of northern South America through the Neogene. Data are reviewed from new geochronological datasets using radiogenic and stable isotopes, and from traditional geochronological methods, including sedimentology, structural mapping, sonic and seismic logging, and biostratigraphy. The modern Amazon River and the continental-scale Amazon drainage basin were assembled during the late Miocene and Pliocene, via some of the largest purported river capture events in Earth history. Andean sediments are first recorded in the Amazon Fan at about 10.1-9.4 Ma, with a large increase in sedimentation at about 4.5 Ma. The transcontinental Amazon River therefore formed over a period of about 4.9-5.6 million years, by means of several river capture events. The origins of the modern Amazon River are hypothesized to be linked with that of mega-wetland landscapes of tropical South America (e.g. v\'arzeas, pantanals, seasonally flooded savannahs). Mega-wetlands have persisted over about 10\% northern South America under different configurations for {$>$}15 million years. Although the paleogeographic reconstructions presented are simplistic and coarse-grained, they are offered to inspire the collection and analysis of new sedimentological and geochronological datasets.           ,              RESUMO Este trabalho \'e uma revis\~ao das evid\^encias geol\'ogicas sobre a origem do moderno rio Amazonas transcontinental, e a hist\'oria paleogeogr\'afica das conex\~oes ribeirinhas entre as principais bacias sedimentares do norte da Am\'erica do Sul durante o Ne\'ogeno. S\~ao revisados novos conjuntos de dados geocronol\'ogicos usando is\'otopos radiog\^enicos e est\'aveis, e de m\'etodos geocronol\'ogicos tradicionais, incluindo sedimentologia, mapeamento estrutural, explora\c{c}\~ao s\'ismica e bioestratigrafia. O atual rio Amazonas e sua bacia continental se formaram durante o final do Mioceno e do Plioceno, atrav\'es de alguns dos maiores eventos de captura de rio na hist\'oria da Terra. Os sedimentos andinos s\~ao registrados pela primeira vez no leque fluvial do Amazonas por volta de 10,1-9,4 Ma, com um grande aumento na sedimenta\c{c}\~ao a cerca de 4,5 Ma. O rio Amazonas transcontinental, portanto, se formou durante um per\'iodo de cerca de 4,9 a 5,6 milh\~oes de anos, por meio de v\'arios eventos de captura de rios. Acredita-se que as origens do moderno rio Amazonas estejam ligadas \`as paisagens de inunda\c{c}\~ao da Am\'erica do Sul tropical (por exemplo, v\'arzeas, pantanais, savanas sazonalmente inundadas). As \'areas pantanosas persistiram em cerca de 10\% do norte da Am\'erica do Sul sob diferentes configura\c{c}\~oes por mais de 15 milh\~oes de anos. Embora as reconstru\c{c}\~oes paleogeogr\'aficas apresentadas sejam simplistas, elas s\~ao oferecidas para inspirar a coleta e an\'alise de novos conjuntos de dados sedimentol\'ogicos e geocronol\'ogicos.},

  abstract = {We evaluate the performance of a large ensemble of Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) over South America for a recent past reference period and examine their projections of twenty-first century precipitation and temperature changes. The future changes are computed for two time slices (2040\textendash 2059 and 2080\textendash 2099) relative to the reference period (1995\textendash 2014) under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs, SSP1\textendash 2.6, SSP2\textendash 4.5, SSP3\textendash 7.0 and SSP5\textendash 8.5). The CMIP6 GCMs successfully capture the main climate characteristics across South America. However, they exhibit varying skill in the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation and temperature at the subregional scale, particularly over high latitudes and altitudes. Future precipitation exhibits a decrease over the east of the northern Andes in tropical South America and the southern Andes in Chile and Amazonia, and an increase over southeastern South America and the northern Andes\textemdash a result generally consistent with earlier CMIP (3 and 5) projections. However, most of these changes remain within the range of variability of the reference period. In contrast, temperature increases are robust in terms of magnitude even under the SSP1\textendash 2.6. Future changes mostly progress monotonically from the weakest to the strongest forcing scenario, and from the mid-century to late-century projection period. There is an increase in the seasonality of the intra-annual precipitation distribution, as the wetter part of the year contributes relatively more to the annual total. Furthermore, an increasingly heavy-tailed precipitation distribution and a rightward shifted temperature distribution provide strong indications of a more intense hydrological cycle as greenhouse gas emissions increase. The relative distance of an individual GCM from the ensemble mean does not substantially vary across different scenarios. We found no clear systematic linkage between model spread about the mean in the reference period and the magnitude of simulated sub-regional climate change in the future period. Overall, these results could be useful for regional climate change impact assessments across South America.},

We propose best-practice standards for studies in these assessments.           ,              Demand for models in biodiversity assessments is rising, but which models are adequate for the task? We propose a set of best-practice standards and detailed guidelines enabling scoring of studies based on species distribution models for use in biodiversity assessments. We reviewed and scored 400 modeling studies over the past 20 years using the proposed standards and guidelines. We detected low model adequacy overall, but with a marked tendency of improvement over time in model building and, to a lesser degree, in biological data and model evaluation. We argue that implementation of agreed-upon standards for models in biodiversity assessments would promote transparency and repeatability, eventually leading to higher quality of the models and the inferences used in assessments. We encourage broad community participation toward the expansion and ongoing development of the proposed standards and guidelines.},

In this article, we evaluate the cost of effectively managing all existing protected areas in developing countries, as well as the cost of expansion into highpriority new areas. We find that recent studies converge on a funding shortfall of \$1 billion to \$1.7 billion per year to manage all existing areas. The costs of establishing and managing an expanded protected-area system would total at least \$4 billion per year over the next decade, an amount that far exceeds current spending but is well within the reach of the international community. These findings indicate the need for rapid action to mobilize significant new resources for the developing world's protected areas. In particular, this will require (a) the use of a range of tools to generate funds and improve efficiency of management; (b) greater precision and better communication of the costs and benefits of protected areas, both locally and globally; and (c) increased, stable support from developed countries for on-the-ground management of protected-area systems in developing countries.},

We present ideas for future research in each of these areas and discuss future directions for Amblypygi behavioral ecology research as they relate to four areas of behavioral ecology: adaptation, evolutionary history, mechano-sensory control of behavior, and behavioral development. We conclude by identifying several avenues of Amblypygi behavioral ecology that we think have the highest potential for transformative discoveries.},

  abstract = {The duality between ``niche'' and ``biotope'' proposed by G. Evelyn Hutchinson provides a powerful way to conceptualize and analyze biogeographical distributions in relation to spatial environmental patterns. Both Joseph Grinnell and Charles Elton had attributed niches to environments. Attributing niches, instead, to species, allowed Hutchinson's key innovation: the formal severing of physical place from environment that is expressed by the duality. In biogeography, the physical world (a spatial extension of what Hutchinson called the biotope) is conceived as a map, each point (or cell) of which is characterized by its geographical coordinates and the local values of               n               environmental attributes at a given time. Exactly the same               n               environmental attributes define the corresponding niche space, as niche axes, allowing reciprocal projections between the geographic distribution of a species, actual or potential, past or future, and its niche. In biogeographical terms, the realized niche has come to express not only the effects of species interactions (as Hutchinson intended), but also constraints of dispersal limitation and the lack of contemporary environments corresponding to parts of the fundamental niche. Hutchinson's duality has been used to classify and map environments; model potential species distributions under past, present, and future climates; study the distributions of invasive species; discover new species; and simulate increasingly more realistic worlds, leading to spatially explicit, stochastic models that encompass speciation, extinction, range expansion, and evolutionary adaptation to changing environments.},

We included monthly temperature (minimum, maximum and average), precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure and wind speed, aggregated across a target temporal range of 1970\textendash 2000, using data from between 9000 and 60 000 weather stations. Weather station data were interpolated using thin-plate splines with covariates including elevation, distance to the coast and three satellite-derived covariates: maximum and minimum land surface temperature as well as cloud cover, obtained with the MODIS satellite platform. Interpolation was done for 23 regions of varying size depending on station density. Satellite data improved prediction accuracy for temperature variables 5\textendash 15\% (0.07\textendash 0.17 {$\circ$}C), particularly for areas with a low station density, although prediction error remained high in such regions for all climate variables. Contributions of satellite covariates were mostly negligible for the other variables, although their importance varied by region. In contrast to the common approach to use a single model formulation for the entire world, we constructed the final product by selecting the best performing model for each region and variable. Global cross-validation correlations were {$\geq$} 0.99 for temperature and humidity, 0.86 for precipitation and 0.76 for wind speed. The fact that most of our climate surface estimates were only marginally improved by use of satellite covariates highlights the importance having a dense, high-quality network of climate station data.},

However, users often underestimate the strong links between data type, model output and suitability for end-use. We synthesize current knowledge and provide a simple framework that summarizes how interactions between data type and the sampling process (i.e. imperfect detection and sampling bias) determine the quantity that is estimated by a SDM. We then draw upon the published literature and simulations to illustrate and evaluate the information needs of the most common ecological, biogeographical and conservation applications of SDM outputs. We find that, while predictions of models fitted to the most commonly available observational data (presence records) suffice for some applications, others require estimates of occurrence probabilities, which are unattainable without reliable absence records. Our literature review and simulations reveal that, while converting continuous SDM outputs into categories of assumed presence or absence is common practice, it is seldom clearly justified by the application's objective and it usually degrades inference. Matching SDMs to the needs of particular applications is critical to avoid poor scientific inference and management outcomes. This paper aims to help modellers and users assess whether their intended SDM outputs are indeed fit for purpose.},

  abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950\textendash 2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledgebased methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

We present a probabilistic treatment of the presence-only problem and derive a method to assess the performance of SDMs based on the analysis of an area-presence plot and the SDM outputs represented in both geographic and environmental spaces. We show how our method is useful to solve the two main tasks for which the AUC is used: assessing the performance of an SDM and comparing the performance of different SDMs. Our results build on previous work and constitute a rigorous method for assessing the performance of SDMs in relation to a random classifier. We establish comparisons with two of the most popular approaches used to assess the performance of an SDM, the AUC and the Boyce index, and identified cases in which our method has advantages over these two approaches. We suggest that the performance of an algorithm that classifies presence-only data can be assessed by two factors: (a) the degree of non-randomness of the classification at every step in the accumulation curve of presences, and (b) the amount of uninformative niche space used for the classification. The method we developed can be applied to any SDM output by using the R functions available at: https://github.com/LauraJim/SDM-hyperTest.},

The temperature algorithm is based on statistical downscaling of atmospheric temperatures. The precipitation algorithm incorporates orographic predictors including wind fields, valley exposition, and boundary layer height, with a subsequent bias correction. The resulting data consist of a monthly temperature and precipitation climatology for the years 1979\textendash 2013. We compare the data derived from the CHELSA algorithm with other standard gridded products and station data from the Global Historical Climate Network. We compare the performance of the new climatologies in species distribution modelling and show that we can increase the accuracy of species range predictions. We further show that CHELSA climatological data has a similar accuracy as other products for temperature, but that its predictions of precipitation patterns are better.},

Given that arthropod distributions are strongly influenced by microclimatic conditions and microhabitat structure, they should be an ideal candidate group for SDM research, especially generalist predators because they are not directly dependent on vegetation or prey types. However, most SDM studies of animals to date have focused either on broad samples of vertebrates or on arthropod species that are charismatic (e.g. butterflies) or economically important (e.g. vectors of disease, crop pests and pollinators). By means of a systematic bibliometric approach, we targeted the literature published on key terrestrial arthropod predators (ants, ground beetles and spiders), chosen as a model to explore challenges and opportunities of species distribution modelling in mega-diverse arthropod groups. We show that the use of SDMs to map the geography of terrestrial arthropod predators has been a recent phenomenon, with a near-exponential growth in the number of studies over the past 10 years and still limited collaborative networks among researchers. There is a bias in studies towards charismatic species and geographical areas that hold lower levels of diversity but greater availability of data, such as Europe and North America. To overcome some of these data limitations, we illustrate the potential of modern data sources (citizen science programmes, online databases) and new modelling approaches (ensemble of small models, modelling above the species level). Finally, we discuss areas of research where SDMs may be combined with dispersal models and increasingly available phylogenetic and functional data to obtain mechanistic descriptions of species distributions and their spatiotemporal shifts within a global change perspective.},

How to generalize species distributions in large undersampled areas, especially with few samples, is a fundamental issue of SDMs. In order to explore this issue, we used the best available presence records for the Hooded Crane (Grus monacha, n = 33), White-naped Crane (Grus vipio, n = 40), and Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricollis, n = 75) in China as three case studies, employing four powerful and commonly used machine learning algorithms to map the breeding distributions of the three species: TreeNet (Stochastic Gradient Boosting, Boosted Regression Tree Model), Random Forest, CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and Maxent (Maximum Entropy Models). In addition, we developed an ensemble forecast by averaging predicted probability of the above four models results. Commonly used model performance metrics (Area under ROC (AUC) and true skill statistic (TSS)) were employed to evaluate model accuracy. The latest satellite tracking data and compiled literature data were used as two independent testing datasets to confront model predictions. We found Random Forest demonstrated the best performance for the most assessment method, provided a better model fit to the testing data, and achieved better species range maps for each crane species in undersampled areas. Random Forest has been generally available for more than 20 years and has been known to perform extremely well in ecological predictions. However, while increasingly on the rise, its potential is still widely underused in conservation, (spatial) ecological applications and for inference. Our results show that it informs ecological and biogeographical theories as well as being suitable for conservation applications, specifically when the study area is undersampled. This method helps to save modelselection time and effort, and allows robust and rapid assessments and decisions for efficient conservation.},

Yet, the two European species are expected to react differently to forthcoming environmental changes, because of habitat specialization and initial range. We used an original combination of habitat and dispersal data to revisit these predictions under various climatic scenarios. We used the future range of suitable habitat, predicted with habitat variables only, as a base layer to further predict the range or reachable habitat by accounting for both dispersal ability and landscape connectivity. Our results confirm the northward shift in range and indicate that the area of co-occurrences should also increase. However, reachable habitat should expand less than suitable habitat, especially when accounting for landscape connectivity. In addition, the potential range expansion was further limited for the red-listed               D. plantarius,               which is more of a habitat specialist and has a lower ability to disperse. This study highlights the importance of looking beyond habitat variables to produce more accurate predictions for the future of arthropods populations.},

  abstract = {Conservation scientists generally agree that many types of protected areas will be needed to protect tropical forests. But little is known of the comparative performance of inhabited and uninhabited reserves in slowing the most extreme form of forest disturbance: conversion to agriculture. We used satellite-based maps of land cover and fire occurrence in the Brazilian Amazon to compare the performance of large ({$>$}10,000 ha) uninhabited (parks) and inhabited (indigenous lands, extractive reserves, and national forests) reserves. Reserves significantly reduced both deforestation and fire. Deforestation was 1.7 (extractive reserves) to 20 (parks) times higher along the outside versus the inside of the reserve perimeters and fire occurrence was 4 (indigenous lands) to 9 (national forests) times higher. No strong difference in the inhibition of deforestation (p = 0.11) or fire (p = 0.34) was found between parks and indigenous lands. However, uninhabited reserves tended to be located away from areas of high deforestation and burning rates. In contrast, indigenous lands were often created in response to frontier expansion, and many prevented deforestation completely despite high rates of deforestation along their boundaries. The inhibitory effect of indigenous lands on deforestation was strong after centuries of contact with the national society and was not correlated with indigenous population density. Indigenous lands occupy one-fifth of the Brazilian Amazon\textemdash five times the area under protection in parks\textemdash and are currently the most important barrier to Amazon deforestation. As the protected-area network expands from 36\% to 41\% of the Brazilian Amazon over the coming years, the greatest challenge will be successful reserve implementation in high-risk areas of frontier expansion as indigenous lands are strengthened.

  abstract = {Background: Understanding the evolutionary history of morphologically cryptic species complexes is difficult, and made even more challenging when geographic distributions have been modified by human-mediated dispersal. This situation is common in the Mediterranean Basin where, aside from the environmental heterogeneity of the region, protracted human presence has obscured the biogeographic processes that shaped current diversity. Loxosceles rufescens (Araneae, Sicariidae) is an ideal example: native to the Mediterranean, the species has dispersed worldwide via cohabitation with humans. A previous study revealed considerable molecular diversity, suggesting cryptic species, but relationships among lineages did not correspond to geographic location. Results: Delimitation analyses on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I identified 11 different evolutionary lineages, presenting two contrasting phylogeographic patterns: (1) lineages with well-structured populations in Morocco and Iberia, and (2) lineages lacking geographic structure across the Mediterranean Basin. Dating analyses placed main diversification events in the Pleistocene, and multiple Pleistocene refugia, identified using ecological niche modeling (ENM), are compatible with allopatric differentiation of lineages. Human-mediated transportation appears to have complicated the current biogeography of this medically important and synanthropic spider. Conclusions: We integrated ecological niche models with phylogeographic analyses to elucidate the evolutionary history of L. rufescens in the Mediterranean Basin, with emphasis on the origins of mtDNA diversity. We found support for the hypothesis that northern Africa was the center of origin for L. rufescens, and that current genetic diversity originated in allopatry, likely promoted by successive glaciations during the Pleistocene. We corroborated the scenario of multiple refugia within the Mediterranean, principally in northern Africa, combining results from eight atmosphere\textendash ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) with two different refugium-delimitation methodologies. ENM results were useful for providing general views of putative refugia, with fine-scale details depending on the level of stringency applied for agreement among models.},

Rangel               et al.               simulated the past 800,000 years of evolution in South America, incorporating these factors into a spatially explicit dynamic model to explore the geographical generation of diversity. Their simulations, based on a paleoclimate model on a 5\textdegree{} latitude-longitude scale, result in shifting maps of speciation, persistence, and extinction (or cradles, museums, and graves). The simulations culminate in a striking resemblance to contemporary distribution patterns across the continent for birds, mammals, and plants\textemdash despite having no target patterns and no empirical data parameterizing them.

To meet this challenge, we built a spatially explicit, mechanistic model that simulates the history of life on the South American continent, driven by modeled climates of the past 800,000 years. Operating at the level of geographical ranges of populations, our simulations implemented adaptation, geographical range shifts, range fragmentation, speciation, long-distance dispersal, competition between species, and extinction. Only four parameters were required to control these processes (dispersal distance, evolutionary rate, time for speciation, and intensity of competition). To assess the effects of topographic heterogeneity, we experimentally smoothed the climate maps in some treatments.                                         RATIONALE               The simulations had no target patterns. Instead, the study took a fundamental approach, relying on the realism of the modeled ecological and evolutionary processes, theoretical derivations of parameter values, and the climatic and topographic drivers to produce meaningful biogeographical patterns. The model encompassed only the Late Quaternary (last 800,000 years), with its repeated glacial-interglacial cycles, beginning at a time when South America was already populated with a rich biota, comprising many distinct lineages. Nonetheless, current consensus holds that the contemporary flora and vertebrate fauna of South America include numerous lineages that have undergone rapid diversification during the Quaternary, particularly in the Andes. In our model, over the course of each simulation, a complete phylogeny emerged from a single founding species. On the basis of the full historical records for each species range, at each 500-year interval, we recorded spatial and temporal patterns of speciation (``cradles''), persistence (``museums''), extinction (``graves''), and species richness.                                         RESULTS               Simulated historical patterns of species richness, as recorded by maps of the richness of persistent (museum) species, proved quite successful in capturing the broad features of maps of contemporary species richness for birds, mammals, and plants. Factorial experiments varying parameter settings and initial conditions revealed the relative impact of the evolutionary and ecological processes that we modeled, as expressed in spatial and temporal patterns of cradles, museums, graves, and species richness. These patterns were most sensitive to the geographical location of the founding species and to the rate of evolutionary adaptation. Experimental topographic smoothing confirmed a crucial role for climate heterogeneity in the diversification of clades, especially in the Andes. Analyses of temporal patterns of speciation (cradles) and extinction (graves) emerging from the simulations implicated Quaternary glacial-interglacial cycles as drivers of both diversification and extinction on a continental scale.                                         CONCLUSION               Our biogeographical simulations were constructed from the bottom up, integrating mechanistic models of key ecological and evolutionary processes, following well-supported, widely accepted explanations for how these processes work in nature. Despite being entirely undirected by any target pattern of real-world species richness and covering only a tiny slice of the past, surprisingly realistic continental and regional patterns of species richness emerged from the model. Our simulations confirm a powerful role for adaptive niche evolution, in the context of diversification and extinction driven by topography and climate.                                                   Observed species richness versus modeled (simulated) richness.                                        Upper map: Contemporary South American bird richness (2967 species). Lower map: Simulated spatial pattern for the cumulative richness of persistent (museum) species, arising from the model. The map show results averaged over all parameter values for an Atlantic Rainforest founder, excluding the climate-smoothing experimental treatments. Simulated species richness is highly correlated with observed species richness for birds (                     r                     2                     = 0.6337).                                                                                            ,              Individual processes shaping geographical patterns of biodiversity are increasingly understood, but their complex interactions on broad spatial and temporal scales remain beyond the reach of analytical models and traditional experiments.

Experimental topographic smoothing confirmed the impact of climate heterogeneity on diversification. The simulations identified regions and episodes of speciation (cradles), persistence (museums), and extinction (graves). Although the simulations had no target pattern and were not parameterized with empirical data, emerging richness maps closely resembled contemporary maps for major taxa, confirming powerful roles for evolution and diversification driven by topography and climate.},

Among different conservation strategies, indigenous reserves play a key role by reducing the impact of factors such as the deforestation caused by the expansion of the agricultural frontier. Despite the demonstrated importance of these indigenous territories, there is a lack of studies evaluating their contribution to the regional diversity in Colombia, especially for invertebrate groups. By surveying indigenous territories for the first time in the Amazonas department, we investigated the army ant fauna inhabiting different land use types: forests; ``chagras'' in different stages of regeneration; and pastures. In a sampling plot that represents just 0.0014 \% of the department's area, four genera and eight army ants species were recorded, representing 47 \% of known species in the Amazonas department and 18 \% in Colombia. Our sampling revealed three new records for the department and Neivamyrmex diana as a new record for the country. Mature forests harbored six species, while the chagras system retained up to five species. Notably, when placing our results in a national context, we revealed several country regions and departments (e.g., C\'ordoba, Sucre, Vaup\'es) that presented limited or no information on army ant diversity. Our results provide justification for the continuous evaluation, monitoring and conservation of indigenous reserves, based not only on their demonstrated cultural and ancestral importance but to their potential to retain high biodiversity.},

We found that Indigenous-managed lands were slightly more vertebrate species rich than existing protected areas in all three countries, and in Brazil and Canada, that they supported more threatened vertebrate species than existing protected areas or randomly selected non-protected areas. Our results suggest that overall, Indigenous-managed lands and existing protected areas host similar levels of vertebrate biodiversity in Brazil, Canada, and Australia. Partnerships with Indigenous communities that seek to maintain or enhance Indigenous land tenure practices on Indigenous-managed lands may therefore have some potential to ameliorate national and global shortfalls in land protection for biodiversity conservation using a mix of conventional protected areas and Indigenous-managed lands.},

A fundamental niche (NF) is defined as the set of conditions within which a species can live in the absence of competitors, and a realized niche (NR) is a NF hypothetically reduced by competitive interactions (and some other limiting factors). This definition implies that NF is ``larger'' than NR, something that has been nearly universally accepted by ecologists. However, there have been few attempts at empirical tests. Here, we present a novel quantitative test using one-dimensional estimates of NF for 105 species of reptiles and amphibians, and estimates of NR obtained from \textasciitilde 1.4 x 104 field observations. To specify our test, we operationalize the original classification of niche types.

  abstract = {The anisotropic structure of climatic space may cause significant (and to a large extent unappreciated) nonevolutionary niche shifts. This can be seen mostly in the context of spatial transferability of ecological niche models. We explore this effect using a virtual species in the United States. We created a simple virtual species by postulating its fundamental niche as an ellipse in a two-dimensional realistic climatic space. The climatic combinations defined by the ellipse were projected in the geography of the United States and 2 regions of equal area were selected. The structure of niche in the 2 areas is compared. It is shown that the 2 regions have differently positioned subsets of the environmental space, which creates ``shifts'' in the realized niches despite the fact that no evolution and no biotic interactions are present. The most parsimonious hypothesis when ecological niche modeling reveals shifts in the realized niche is that environmental space is heterogeneous. Without considering differences in the structure of environmental space no speculation about niche evolution or the role of competitors should be attempted.},

  abstract = {Species distribution modeling (SDM) is a booming area of research that has had an exponential increase in use and development in recent years. We performed a search of scientific literature and found 5,533 documents published from 1993 to 2018 using SDM, representing a global network of 4,329 collaborating institutions from 155 countries, with Brazil and Mexico being in the top 10 of the most prolific countries globally. National Autonomous University of Mexico, Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Kansas, and U.S. Geological Survey are the most prolific institutions worldwide. Latin American institutions (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 556) participated in 1,000 (18\% of global productivity) documents published in collaboration with 591 institutions outside Latin American countries, from which the National Autonomous University of Mexico, Federal University of Goia\textasciiacute s, Institute of Ecology A.C., National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, University of S\textasciitilde ao Paulo, and University of Brasilia were the most productive. From this body of literature, the most frequently modeled taxonomic groups were Chordata and Insecta, and the most common realms of application were conservation planning and management, climate change, species conservation, epidemiology, evolutionary biology, and biological invasions. From the 36 modeling methods identified to generate SDMs, MaxEnt is used in 73.5\% of the papers, followed by Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP) with 18.7\%, and just 7.4\% of the papers compared between 3 and 10 modeling methods. In Latin American countries, productivity in SDM research could be improved as the network of collaborations diversifies and connects with other productive countries (such as United Kingdom, China, Spain, Germany, Australia, and France). The scientific collaboration between Latin American countries should be increased, as the most prolific countries (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia) share less than 10\% of its productivity. Some of the main challenges for SDM development in Latin America include bridging the gaps from (a) software use to research productivity and (b) translation to decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose to strengthen communities of practice where modelers, species experts, and decisionmakers come together to discuss and develop SDM to shift and enhance current paradigms on how science and decisionmaking are linked.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem health and zoonotic diseases are closely interwoven. Even as we grapple with the SARSCoronavirus-2 pandemic, which may have its origins in wildlife, weakening environmental policies in the Brazilian Amazon are elevating the risk of additional zoonotic spillover events. We examine the links between deforestation and disease emergence in the Amazon, as illustrated by outbreaks of yellow fever virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and Oropouche virus. It has been well established that in Brazil, indigenous territories exhibit lower rates of forest conversion and degradation than in areas designated for sustainable use. In this way, Amazonia's indigenous tribes promote public health while sustaining ecosystem services. However, indigenous land rights are under attack due to current policies enabling illegal land grabbing, mining and logging. Further adding to the existential struggle of indigenous tribes, malaria and SARS-Coronavirus-2 are wreaking havoc on these vulnerable populations. There is a critical need for protection of indigenous people's rights and health, as well as a sustained effort to support the study of mechanisms underlying anthropogenic land use change and zoonotic disease risk. \'O 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Legally recognized Indian reserves of Brazilian Amazonia span over 100 million ha of largely intact forest and are potentially valuable for biodiversity conservation. An important example is provided by the Kayap\'o territories which span more than 13 million ha in Par\'a and Mato Grosso, Brazil, and protect a unique and vulnerable Amazonian forest type that is poorly represented in existing nature reserves. The Kayap\'o of southern Par\'a have stopped invasion of their lands by the most perverse threats to Amazonian forests, but they have become involved extensively in the sale of illegal logging concessions for the high-value timber species mahogany (               Swietenia macrophylla               ). In 1992, the non-governmental organization Conservation International do Brasil (CI-Brasil) began a conservation and development project with the Kayap\'o community of A'Ukre with the objective of providing economic alternatives to logging and protecting a population of mahogany trees. This paper demonstrates the conservation benefits that can be achieved by supporting sustainable development of indigenous peoples in the Amazon. Specifically, we: (1) evaluate the ecological importance of the Kayap\'o reserves from a biodiversity conservation viewpoint, (2) evaluate the conservation success of the CI-Brasil project and test whether the implementation of the conservation alliance between A'Ukre and CI-Brasil satisfies common pool resource principles, and (3) propose a model for expanding the small-scale conservation results achieved by the CI-Brasil project to all Kayap\'o territories. Several mammals (               Tayassu pecari               ,               Pteronura brasiliensis               ,               Priodontes maximus               ,               Panthera onca               ) and at least one bird species (               Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus               ) listed as endangered were regularly encountered within 15 km of A'Ukre. Taxa encountered at relatively high densities in the project area included large cracids, lowland tapir, and white-lipped peccary, indicating an ecosystem that is not severely impacted by hunting. Harvest offtakes of mahogany averaged 0.44 stems ha               -1               within groves and 0.13 stems ha               -1               at the landscape level. We estimate that 85\% of the fruiting population of               Swietenia macrophylla               has been removed in harvested Kayap\'o territories in Par\'a. We found Kayap\'o social organization in A'Ukre to meet criteria of successful common pool resource institutions. The CI-Brasil project resulted in protection of an intact mahogany population in 8000 ha of forest maintained by the community for ecological research purposes and mahogany preservation. Our analysis attributes the success of the conservation alliance with A'Ukre to: (1) direct benefits accruing to all members of the community, (2) fulfilment of criteria for development of common pool resource institutions, and (3) long-term commitment of an external agency. We propose that by implementing these three elements elsewhere, the modest conservation result achieved at A'Ukre could be expanded to include the entire Kayap\'o nation and thereby contribute to conservation of more than 13 000 000 ha of forest and cerrado in the south-eastern Amazon.},
